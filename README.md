# Project-2
In this project, I designed a user-friendly electronic web store"SparkTech" using wireframing and mockup design techniques. I sketched wireframes to outline layout and functionality, then create mockups. I created a Home Page, Services Page, Log In, Sign In and check out pages in both design techniques.
