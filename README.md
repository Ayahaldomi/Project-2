# Project-2
In this project, I'll design a user-friendly electronic web store using wireframing and mockup techniques. Researching existing stores will guide my design choices. I'll sketch wireframes to outline layout and functionality, then create high-fidelity mockups. Feedback will refine designs, ensuring seamless browsing across devices. This project aims for a captivating user experience and smooth implementation.
